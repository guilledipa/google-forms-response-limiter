# Google forms â€“ Response limiter

This is a *very* simplisting response limiter that only accounts for number of responses in a Google Form.

## Install

1. Click on the three vertical dots and open the **Script editor**
2. Copy-Paste `Code.gs` and `Sidebar.html` into your editor & save the changes; you can rename the project (top left, whichever way you want, e.g. "Form response limiter")
3. Back in your Form edit view, refresh the page (you should see a new icon appear left of the "customize theme" icon, which is called "Add-ons")
4. Click on the "Add-ons" icon and then select your newly created script. Google will ask you to grant the script permissions. You'll need to allow these.
5. Click "Install" and then "Configure response limiter"
6. A side-bar will appear, called "Form limiter
7. Check "Limit form responses" and then select the max number.

When the number of responses hits the limit set in step 7, the script will auto-close the Form.
